    Python Applications
        can be used with web, mobile, video, embed

    Python programming
        interactive mode
            type python into CMD and you go into the REPL
        script mode
            make your py file and send it to the cmd using python [file_name].py
        
        or use interactive GUI to do both

    Python Variables
        you do not need to give variables a type in python
        
        -Python assignments
            single assign
                [identifier_name]= [value]
            
            multiple assign
                [identifier_name]= [identifier_name]= ... [value]

            Assigning multiple values to multiple variables:
                [identifier_name], [identifier_name]... = [value], [value] ...

            
            Tokens
                Tokens can be defined as a punctuator mark, reserved words and each individual word in a statement.
                Token is the smallest unit inside the given program.
                There are following tokens in Python:
                
                Keywords.
                Identifiers.
                Literals.
                Operators.

            Tuples:
                like list but closed in parenthese and cant be changed

                tuple = ([value],[value] ...);
                but you can do this
                
                tuple + tuple_other = ([all_value_1st],[all_value_2nd]);

            Dictionary:
                key value pair

                [identifier] = {"[key]":[value],"[key]":[value]}
                [identifier].dict ();

                [identifier].keys() returns keys in square bracket
                [identifier].values() returns values in square bracket

        Python Keywords

            True	    False	None	and	        as
            asset	    def	    class	continue	break
            else	    finally	elif	del	        except
            global	    for	    if	    from	    import
            raise	    try	    or  	return	    pass
            nonlocal	in	    not	    is	        lambda

        Python Identifiers

            An identifier is a long sequence of characters and numbers.
            No special character except underscore ( _ ) can be used as an identifier.
            Keyword should not be used as an identifier name.
            case sensitive
            First character of an identifier can be character, underscore ( _ ) but not digit
    
        Python Literals
            
            Literals can be defined as a data that is given in a variable or constant.

            -String literals:
                single line
                    [identifier] = '[string]'
        
                mutiple line
                    [identifier] = '[string] \
                    [complete_string]'

                    [identifier] =  """[string]
                    [string] """

            -Numeric literals
                Int(signed integers) -- no fraction
                Long(long integers) -- number must be followed by L
                    [number]L
                float(floating point) -- can have fraction
                Complex(complex) -- a +bj a real, b imaginary
            
            -Boolean literals:
                called none
                None is used to specify to that field that is not created. It is also used for end of lists in Python.

            -Literal Collections.
                lists, tuples and dictionary

                what makes python lists a list
                    List contain items of different data types. Lists are mutable i.e., modifiable.
                    The values stored in List are separated by commas(,) and enclosed within a square brackets([]). We can store different type of data in a List.
                    Value stored in a List can be retrieved using the slice operator([] and [:]).
                    The plus sign (+) is the list concatenation and asterisk(*) is the repetition operator.

                    if you put a decimal ITS unix python will output the nearest decimal to 10 places
